        and Robert Ascher, after having analyzed several hundred <i>quipus</i>, have shown that most information on
        <i>quipus</i> is numeric, and these numbers can be read. Each cluster of knots is a digit, and there are three
        main types of knots: simple

          >figure-eight knots</a
        >. In the Aschers’ system, a fourth type of knot—figure-eight knot with an extra twist—is referred to as "EE".
        A number is represented as a sequence of knot clusters in base 10.<sup

      <ul>
        <li>
          Powers of ten are shown by position along the string, and this position is aligned between successive
          strands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Digits in positions for 10 and higher powers are represented by clusters of simple knots (e.g., 40 is four
          simple knots in a row in the "tens" position).
        </li>
        <li>
          Digits in the "ones" position are represented by long knots (e.g., 4 is a knot with four turns). Because of
          the way the knots are tied, the digit 1 cannot be shown this way and is represented in this position by a
          figure-eight knot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="/wiki/Zero"

            >Zero</a
          >
          is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because the ones digit is shown in a distinctive way, it is clear where a number ends. One strand on a
          <i>quipu</i> can therefore contain several numbers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For example, if 4s represents four simple knots, 3L represents a long knot with three turns, E represents a
        figure-eight knot and X represents a space:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>The number 731 would be represented by 7s, 3s, E.</li>
        <li>The number 804 would be represented by 8s, X, 4L.</li>
        <li>The number 107 followed by the number 51 would be represented by 1s, X, 7L, 5s, E.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
      This reading can be confirmed by a fortunate fact: <i>quipus</i> regularly contain sums in a systematic way. For
      instance, a cord may contain the sum of the next <i>n</i> cords, and this relationship is repeated throughout
      the <i>quipu</i>. Sometimes there are sums of sums as well. Such a relationship would be very improbable if the
      knots were incorrectly read.<sup
